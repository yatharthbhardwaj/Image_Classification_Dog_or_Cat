CNN Image Classification Model
Welcome to my Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classification model repository!

Overview
This model has been meticulously trained on a dataset comprising 4000 images of dogs and 4000 images of cats. Leveraging deep learning techniques, this model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 81%.

Key Features
High Accuracy: With an accuracy rate of 81%, my model demonstrates robust performance in discerning between images of dogs and cats.
Robustness: my model exhibits a remarkable capability to handle complex images, even those that may pose challenges for human identification. Notably, in image 4 of our dataset, the model correctly identified the subject as a dog, showcasing its exceptional predictive accuracy.
